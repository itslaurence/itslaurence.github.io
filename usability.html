		<h1>Usability study</h1>
		<h2 id="method">
			method: the evaluated website was the portfolio website. 
					target audience was peers
					we made a google form to answer questions such as where information was on the page
		</h2>
		<h2>
			results: most of he subjects were able to navigate around the website but 
					some could not find some information
		</h2>
		<h2>
