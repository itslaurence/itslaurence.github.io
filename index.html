			he link to this unit is includes an informational video on Career and Technical education.  Career and technical education helps students get a head start on the major they would like to pursue in the future.  The reasons for magnet schools isn't entirely just to help a student get ahead either.  It helps them understand what they might get into in the future if they persue that and they can change early if it's not what they were looking forward to rather than wasting money on a college major that they will not like.</p>

		<ul>
				<li>letting students know what CTE (Career and Technical Edcation) is and what it deos</li>
				<li>every program is different and help students advance more into that particular major</li>
				<li>CTE schools helps bring together students with the same interests in that subject collaborate together</li>

		</ul>

	<h2>Unit 3</h2>
	<p>	Style sheets are important in coding.  It adds more empasis to the viewer as well as give life to the page.  When you have a style sheet added to your web page, your limits on what you can do is expanded by a lot.  CSS is one of the main parts of creating web pages.  If you don't have a style sheet added to a web page, it will just be blank with words going across the screen.  Style sheets catches the consumer's attention and makes them want to stay on the page you created.</p>

	<h2>Unit 4</h2>
	  <h3 id="buttions">unit on buttons</h3>

   		      <img src="_assets/images/Camera_Button.gif" style="border:none"
   		 alt="Camera"/></a>
   		<p> In this unit, we learned a good number of things that can be useful when creating your own website.  Adding a thumbnail to the intex page helps give a preview of what the image looks like.  Buttons are also important when creating your website because it adds a more visual way to get to places.  The mail button on the index page is an alternative for visual people that need to email the creator of the website.  Banners and backgound images also give more life to the page.  When you have a banner, you can advertise or make the website more visual appealing. </p>

	<h2>Unit 5</h2>
	<p>javascript is very useful and interesting to use when creating a web page.  With JavaScript, you are able to make things ineractive with the users of the site.  JavaScript also makes the website come to life because there is more interaction to get to the page that you need or the fuction you need to display.  Being able to hide and show things with javascript helps make it easier for the user to navigate and show only what they need.  The functions of javascript can help a lot with flow and interaction.</p>

	<h2>Unit 6</h2>
	<p> This unit was useful in many ways, especially when it came to validation.  Using a validation website to make sure your html code complies with the standards of the web.  The validation website helped fix the code that was missing or "broken".  The usability testing was also useful because you think your website is easy to navigate, others might not find it </p>
